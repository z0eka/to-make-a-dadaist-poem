      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.

      const article = `The Climate Council has issued a pre-election call for all Australian political parties to acknowledge the climate crisis is driving worsening disasters, including the “megafloods” in Queensland and New South Wales.

The Australian Industry Group also declared on Monday that Australia’s former competitive advantage in carbon-intensive energy was “gone” and the country needed “coherent and efficient action” to build a new advantage in clean energy.

With an election due by May, the Climate Council said “too many leaders” were silent or absent on the climate crisis, and Australians were “paying a high price” for the lack of meaningful action.

“Climate change isn’t a footnote to the story of these floods. It is the story,” the Climate Council said in a statement on Monday.

The organisation – which brings together climate scientists, health, renewable energy and policy experts – issued a four-point call for all federal political parties and candidates.

That includes actively acknowledging “the destructive role that climate change is playing in driving worsening disasters including these megafloods”.
